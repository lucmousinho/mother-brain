# Memory Sectors Template

Create these files inside OpenClaw workspace:

- memory/sectors/marketing.md
- memory/sectors/engineering-fullstack.md
- memory/sectors/sales.md
- memory/sectors/finance.md
- memory/sectors/operations.md
- memory/sectors/general.md

And copy `templates/sector-router.json` to:

- memory/sector-router.json

The executing skill will use this router to classify intent, recall sector context, and record sector-tagged runs.
